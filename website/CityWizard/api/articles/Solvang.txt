It has been developed as a themed town since attracting national media attention in 1947. The city is home to a number of bakeries, restaurants, and merchants offering a taste of Denmark in California. The architecture of many of the façades and buildings reflects traditional Danish style. There is a copy of the famous Little Mermaid statue from Copenhagen, as well as one featuring the bust of famed Danish fable writer Hans Christian Andersen. A 1:3 scale replica of Copenhagen's Round Tower or Rundetårn was finished in 1991 and can be seen in the town center.
Founded by Danish immigrants, many descendants still live in the town and possess local political influence. The town frequently attracts tourists from the Nordic countries, and has been the subject of several Danish royal visits, most recently by Prince Henrik in 2011.Mission Santa Inés, one of the California missions (National Historic Landmark), is located near the center of the town, at the junction of State Route 246 and Alisal Road.
