1 (one, also called unit, and unity) is a number and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals.For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1.It is also sometimes considered the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers, followed by 2, although by other definitions 1 is the second natural number, following 0.The fundamental mathematical property of 1 is to be a multiplicative identity, meaning that any number multiplied by 1 returns that number.In advanced mathematics, a multiplicative identity is often denoted 1, even if it is not a number.
