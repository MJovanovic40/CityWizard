The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country primarily located in North America.In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent.Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition.During the Cold War, the United States fought the Korean War and the Vietnam War but avoided direct military conflict with the Soviet Union.The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower.
