Watch Dogs was derived from a potential sequel from the Driver series which had been in development at Ubisoft Montreal coincident to Driver: San Francisco at Ubisoft Reflections and was released in 2011.Driver: San Francisco did not have a strong commercial performance, leading to the Driver game at Montreal being reworked into one that focused on hacking but still incorporated driving elements.Ubisoft Montreal was Watch Dogs' lead developer, with additional support provided by Ubisoft Reflections, Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Quebec, and Ubisoft Bucharest.The game was heavily anticipated following its gameplay reveal at E3 2012, though the final game, which was accused of graphical downgrading, triggered controversy.The game was released for Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in May 2014, and a Wii U version was released in November 2014.
