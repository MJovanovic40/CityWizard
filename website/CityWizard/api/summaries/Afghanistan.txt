Afghanistan ( (listen); Pashto/Dari: افغانستان, Afġānestān [avɣɒnesˈtɒn]), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a mountainous landlocked country at the crossroads of Central and South Asia.The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak dynasty, whose founder Mirwais Hotak declared southern Afghanistan independent in 1709.In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in "the Great Game" between the British and Russian empires.In the First Anglo-Afghan War, 1839 to 1842, British forces from India at first seized control of Afghanistan, but then were decisively defeated.By 1996, most of the country was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban, who ruled as a totalitarian regime; they were removed from power after the US invasion in 2001 but still control a significant portion of the country.Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.
